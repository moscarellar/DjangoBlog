<details><summary>Imagery</summary>
The images you are greeted to when entering the website are of varying style. Most of the photos you will see are uploaded by the user, but the header image will always be as shown below. This is also used as the placeholder image when a user chooses to not upload a photo to their post.

</details>

<details><summary>Color Scheme</summary>
Three colors are used in this website, these being #000000, #FFFFFF and #FF0030. The background, text and foreground colors have a sufficient contrast ratio to aid with accessibility.

<details><summary>Fonts</summary>
The font used throughout the website is Space Grotesk. I used only 1 font for the site, but used text-transform to make some of the text uppercase.

I have also set up the Nav Bar to be viewed on smaller screen sizes, with the help of Bootstraps .navbar-toggler class.

</details>

<details><summary>Add Post</summary>
 
This page of the website allows the user to create their own blog post. I implemented a rich text editor which allows the user to add a bit more style to their post. For security reasons I have to give the user staff privileges to be able to post, which is common practice in other professional websites. This is to ensure that not just anyone off the internet can find my website and post questionable things.

The purpose of this is to fulfill the following user stories:
```
As a Frequent User, I can create my own blog post and post it on the website.
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98277650/188750032-7fd19423-9acf-4851-80fb-bb2af0e0365b.png)

</details>

<details><summary>Edit/Delete Post</summary>
 
If the user is the author of the post, two buttons appear on the post detail section giving them the ability to edit or delete the post. This is to aid the user in correcting issues with the post, or just to delete it and start again fresh.

The purpose of this is to fulfill the following user stories:
```
As a Frequent User, I can edit or delete my own posts.
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98277650/188750267-9fe41ace-f585-42a9-bafa-7c69fdb28e04.png)

When the user clicks the delete button they are taken to a new page with a warning, making sure they are aware that they are about to permanently delete the post. This is so if they change their mind and want to keep it, they can.

</details>

## Features Left to Implement

<details><summary>Password Reset</summary>
I would like to implement a password reset feature. This would send an email to the users associated email address with a temporary password. They would then use said password to gain access to their account and change their password manually.
</details>

<details><summary>Contact Us</summary>
I would like to eventually implement a Contact Us page to the website. Users would be able to send enquiries to me via a form.
</details>

<details><summary>Reply to comments</summary>
I would like to add a feature that allows the user to reply to comments on a post. This could be a reply in a thread format or something else entirely. This would add a personal touch to the comments section, enabling users to interact with one another.

## Bugs
For this website I decided to open a project on the GitHub repository, that I would add to as I go along. This is to aid with the transparency of my coding, showing the bugs I encountered and how they were fixed.  
* [CKEDITOR causing deployment failure](https://github.com/jrdnbrkfld/pp4-gamernetic/issues/23)
* [Requires the user to create their own slug field.](https://github.com/jrdnbrkfld/pp4-gamernetic/issues/25)

***

# Deployment

 This project was deployed using Code Institute's mock terminal for Heroku.
* Fork or clone this repository
* Create a new Heroku app
* Set the buildpacks to Python and NodeJS in that order
* Link the Heroku app to the repository
* Click on Deploy

# Credits
I'd like to thank my mentor [Ronan McClelland](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronanmcclelland/) for their help and support throughout this project. I'd also like to thank my cohorts in the Code Institute Slack community, and the Tutor Assistance for all their help with code issues.

The [Code Institute Python Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) was used as a base for this project and made into my own.
